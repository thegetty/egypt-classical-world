Figure 6.4. Bust of Emperor Hadrian. The usual image of the mythical gorgon Medusa decorating the emperor’s breastplate has been replaced by a portrait of Antinous. The bust was found on the western side of the river, close to the exedra on which it stood, along with many other portraits

Figure 6.5. Bust of Artemis Ephesia. This bust represents a copy of the cult statue of Artemis, known mainly from coins. On her head she wears a *polos *decorated with rosettes, sphinxes, and deer, one of her companion animals. From the sides of the *polos *emerges a disc decorated with a star on the proper right side. The upper part of her breastplate is decorated with a necklace, from which acorns hang. The lower part of her breast supports, up to its point of preservation, two rows of breasts as a fertility symbol or, as other scholars have suggested, gourds, also a fertility symbol.

Figure 6.7. Statue of Antinous-Dionysos. The statue, which originally stood on a podium in the apsis of the building, was removed when the sanctuary was transformed into a mausoleum and placed on a pedestal on the northwest corner of the building, where it was found. Antinous was worshipped here as Dionysos, as also verified by the inscriptions (ΘΕΩ ΔΙΟΝΥΣΩ) found in situ.
